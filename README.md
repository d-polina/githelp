some help for using git

Hello, friend! Welcome to Githelp.

This page contains some hints for using git.

What does it contain?

 + Dictionary (to make the terms be more understandable)
 + Commands (and their description with examples)
 + File statuses (from the point of view of git)
 + Useful features (and their description with instructions where they can be find)

I would like to draw your attention to the fact that this page was created for personal use and not as an official community page.

However, I will be glad if these small hints can help you too!

Thank you for attention. Enjoy using it :)
